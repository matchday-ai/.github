We are a sports visual tracking technology company. We use
Artificial Intelligence to automatically mine deep data from
sports videos in real time.
                
We are a team of hardcore computer vision engineers and at
Matchday.ai we are combing our love for sports and tech to
create state of the art visual tracking systems for multiple
sports. We are already working with some of the biggest name
athletes and broadcasters and are excited for the future.
                
We use cutting edge Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence
technology to automate data collection in sports. Currently most
of the data in sports is collected manually and accessing
data/video is a laborious and expensive process,

We bring the next generation of sports data and analysis that
can collect much more data with higher quality, compared to
manual process.
                
Also, because of the automated nature of our solution and the
efficiency in our design, we are able to generate data for
matches that are being played anywhere,thus making it highly
accessible.
                
With Matchday ai, players playing anywhere can now get the video
of their matches in an easily accessible format on their own
devices. We also are able to deliver data and analysis of each
match that players and coaches can use to train like pros.
